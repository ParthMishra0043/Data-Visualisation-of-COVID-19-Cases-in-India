# Data-Visualisation-of-COVID-19-Cases-in-India
Implementing chart.js and Selenium to visualize covid-19 data on the Django test servers. I've used Selenium for web scraping, to get the maps on the left hand side from https://www.covid19india.org/ and chart.js for drawing the graphs.
Please install Selenium before running the project.
